# Introduction   

Since GitHub API tokens are revoked automatically when uploaded to GitHub, I have included some screenshots and a video demonstrating how the app looks and is used. To build the app and run yourself, you'll need to generate a token yourself and place it in the gradle.properties file in the root directory of the project.
