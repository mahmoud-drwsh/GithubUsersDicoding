I have used the Compose version of the required UI components.

Please make sure that the very latest Android studio is used to compile the code.

The following libraries were used in the writing of the app:

Jetpack Hilt (for dependency injection)
Jetpack Compose (for the UI)
Jetpack SplashScreen 
Jetpack ViewModel
Kotlin Flow
Compose Coil
Retrofit (networking)
Google's Gson (for JSON parsing)
Google's Accompanist (for paging Composables)
Jetpack Room
Jetpack DataStore

I have tried my best to follow the MVVM architecture pattern, and I would love to be advised on how I can improve the app's architecture.

Most of the code I wrote is self-explanatory especially since I am using Compose, but still, I have added comments where I felt needed.

Since there is no prohibition regarding the use of experimental libraries, the app uses some experimental libraries for the sake of making code-reading easier. I am aware of the existence of stable alternatives.

Improvements can be made, especially to the app architecture.
